Each course was a masterpiece, crafted to tantalize both the palate and the senses.

We split an excellent appetizer of lobster ravioli with vegetables and a lobster reduction sauce.  For the main course, my wife had a wonderful tuna tataki with zucchini salad and I had a delicious local white fish with Soba noddles, Japanese vegetables, and Soba sauce.  All of this was nicely accompanied by a Saint V\u00e9ran white wine and finished with a delicious desert of dark chocolate cake with raspberries and raspberry sorbet.  The service was excellent.

I recommend but unlikely to come back.More", "I want all my meals to be like this!!": "We travelled to Vannes for our 20th anniversary and wanted to eat somewhere special. The concept of a blind tasting menu was really novel and unlike anything we have eaten before and we were excited to try it.\n\nOur welcome last night was warm and...friendly from the very beginning and the restaurant was relaxed and intimate with modern, beautiful decor and never felt too formal or uncomfortable.\n\nOur waitress (I think her name was Camille) was wonderfully attentive, adapting the conversation between French and English perfectly based on our understanding, and even offered us the choice of practising our French or speaking in English.\n\nWe chose the seven course tasting menu with the wine pairing. I would normally mention individual courses in a review but by doing this here I would spoil the surprise! Suffice to say it was a perfect mix of outstanding food, wine and entertainment (we love a game!)\n\nEach course was a discovery of flavour, cooked and presented to perfection, the wine pairings were excellent, and we really enjoyed the discussions when we reached the end of each course, guessing the ingredients and the paired wines. It was like tasting flavours (even familiar ones) for the first time! It was like being a child in a sweetshop!\n\nThe concept, the food and the service worked in harmony to create a perfect experience.

Good start, they sold kir with framboise and a...glass of champagne for me.

Then Lotte, decent, then canard, very nice, with a bottle of Beaune. Cheese as an additional cost with a glass of Lussac St Emilion which was good but not \u20ac20 a glass good. Dessert was interesting and tasty. They sell Jamaican Blue Mountain, another sign of excellence in my view. It was very good and the glass of '73 Armagnac. The thing that spoiled it, for both of us (and this is ridiculous) was the cutlery. The forks were badly balanced so they would roll out of your hand. The knife was lovely until you put it on the your plate and it slid into the middle of the plate - very annoying.

Our waiter hardly spoke any English at all, and the extremely complex menu is only written in French. When each dish arrived, the waiter took some time explaining exactly what it was and how it had been made. Now my French is pretty good, but it is conversational and I couldn't follow many of the technical details our waiter was talking about.

This wasn't a big issue for us really (and this is France after all, so obviously everything is in French!)\n\nThe service is excellent, there is a very small intimate dining room, and all the crockery and cutlery is specially made and monogrammed for La Gourmandiere, a nice touch!

Also, it was clear that they meticulously planned out the pacing of the meal, from the amuse bouche to the final coffee and petit fours \u2014 for every table.  There was a short pause between the courses (enough to let you chat and sip your wine) but you never had to sit there wondering if they had forgotten about you (which happened at countless other restaurants, many of which cost more!).

Let's not get too excited, but, credit where it's due. \n\nI had the menu Coeur de Sushi which was 18 pieces for 21.50 Euros and they were all competently made, if a little bland. Sushi is often bland, isn't it?  There's only so much you can do with sticky rice and raw fish. Only once have I had really tasty sushi and that was in Boston. The Brunette ordered something which had Spicy Rolls in it and they were lovely. Perhaps something to do with the Philadelphia cheese in it. (Yes, Philadephia cheese doesn't sound very Japanese. Or any cheese for that matter. But it worked, so who cares.)\n\nSo, does it deserve its lofty position as the best restaurant in Vannes? Well, that depends on how much you like sushi, doesn't it? \n\nFor me, the answer is no.

The watercress said small quiet dogs are no trouble.\n\nThe menu is really small with only a few things on offer for that day/week/month. After speaking with the staff i guess its whats in season etc. as everything is local, or as local as it can be. \n\nService was great considering they prepared all the meals in the little kitchen downstairs. They had a party of people on the first floor and the poor waitress had to keep running up and down the stairs! \n\nFood was spot on and service was great.

On paper, their dishes are very appealing.\n\nIn practice, what you actually get to eat will depend on your luck. Sometimes, it's very good, but other times, it's really just average at best.

It was all too short lived, sadly!\n\nThe waiter was very helpful,...and smiley, and helped me choose from the menu, which can be tricky as I don't eat meat.  I had spotted someone on a nearby table eating a nice looking lunch, which was a ham and goat's cheese salad.  The waiter checked with the chef, who said I could order similar, without the ham, and I asked for a large salad with extra tomatoes. Job done, I thought.\n \nI was looking forward to my lunch, but it all went wrong from here.....The owner arrived with our food, with a brisk, sweeping style, placed the plates in front of us, and was gone.  He had placed a Ham and goat's cheese salad in front of me, so I called him and told him politely that mine was the wrong meal.

He had clearly just removed the ham!\n\nAs the waiter had told me that my salad would be the same price as the ham and goat's cheese salad, then this was clearly poor value at 14.95 euros. But I ate it anyway, not wanting to enrage this man any further, but his attitude had somewhat spoiled the occasion by now. The food was fresh and tasty.\n\nI pointed out the mistake with my salad, as the waiter cleared our plates, and the waiter offered a complimentary tea and coffee.  The owner had got wind of my complaint, clearly, and we ducked as he arrived with the hot drinks!

The whole thing left us quite shocked, as we had looked forward to our lunch, and had done nothing to enrage this person, apart from receiving the wrong plate of food.  \n\nThis man knows nothing about customer service, and does not deserve even the one star that I have given.

They were not...\"off\" exactly, but for sure, they were not fresh. I had the seafood gratin for a starter. It consisted of a whole lot of white sauce with mushrooms and a few items from - what seemed to me - a bag of frozen seafood. As a main, we were both looking forward to the seafood choucroute, which is advertised everywhere as a local delicacy and was presented here as a specialty of the house. It was a disaster! The fish and shellfish were horribly overcooked. The coquilles st-jacques were downright leathery and the large shrimp and langoustines were dry and chewy.  It seemed that everything had been thrown on the grill and forgotten about until they were burnt. Even the cabbage tasted of burn. We are real (Alsace-style) choucroute fans and therefore, we were curious. At 28eur a plate, this turned us off from seafood choucroute for life.  Never again! To boot, we took the recommendation from the waitress for the wine, not being familiar with the dish. In itself, the wine was fine (it was a muscadet), but since everything was cooked to the point being burnt, it got completely lost in the meal. \nThe service was slow and borderline rude, and the waitress looked and acted disinterested (we're not sensitive so we generally don't really care that much, as long as the food is good). But it just added to the lousy experience. I do not know if they had an unforeseen kitchen situation that evening  or what was going on, but we waited a very long time for the main meal to be served (even for French standards). It also took them almost 30 minutes to clear the plates from our table once we were done. Needless to say, we did not finish everything on our plate, and we had liked at least to enjoy the rest of our bottle of wine in peace, but even that was ruined as we were hovering above the smell of cold, burnt fish and cabbage.\nI do not recommend this restaurant based on our experience.
