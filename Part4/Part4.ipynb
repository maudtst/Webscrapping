       "\"A satisfying eveningNot only is the food here very good and quite imaginative but the background music is a surprising plus for this restaurant. We weren’t expecting much when entering but were very pleased with the service and the presentation of the food. The ingredients were chosen...with thoughtfulness, complementing each other to give a well rounded flavour.\\nA well deserved recommendation and hopefully many people will read the reviews and make a beeline for this place.More Worth the detourThe restaurant name describes the food - though only in the best of homes. A relatively simple but really good menu, and a reasonable choice of wines. I had a burger, properly cooked à point, and accompanied with a clever potato pancake rather than a...bun. Best I have had for quite a while. Ingrid had caesar salad, simply but deliciously prepared. Thank you, Eric and Mèlanie. It was worth the detour on our trip to Carnac.More Lovely dinner!Lovely small restaurant in the old city. The menu offers plenty of choices at reasonable prices. High quality, fresh food. The server and chef were both welcoming. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal. \\n\\nThe stairs to the restroom are narrow and very very steep…something to keep in...mind for this with limited youth.More Excellent! My partner and I visited on a cycling tour. The food was excellent, beautifully presented and my fish was perfectly cooked. My dessert of creme brulee was exceptional. The restaurant is run by a husband and wife team and they are very friendly. It's a...small intimate restaurant and we were lucky to get a table as everyone after us were turned away.More Wonderful food and wine, excellent hosts!We are visiting Vannes from the UK and Ireland this restaurant is excellent, superb,  we have had dinner and lunch, the owners are so welcoming and the food and wine is superb! We look forward to coming back! Dog friendly too!! Merci! The welcome was homely and the food a cut above..A very welcoming couple run this restaurant with him managing front of house and she works wonders in the kitchen. Happy to help with menu translation for those of us from the land of kangaroo.  We had one of our most enjoyable meals of our...two week travels around Brittany. Just outside the old centre through the gate at the rear of the Cathedral.  The menu has choices to suit all and my wife particularly enjoyed the griiled vegetable entree and vegetable lasagne. My lamb was cooked as requested accompanied by ratatouille and salad. All finished off with Chocolat Fondant.More\""
